# MUG-2024-05-14-Advent-of-Code
Code discussed in our May 14th meeting.

## What we did at this MUG meeting

At this meeting, several of us looked at the very first Advent of Code problem for 2023; and each of us solved it in a different language.  We presented our results as a demonstration of that language, and that approach to the problem.  Those solutions are in this repo.

## What (and where) is Advent of Code

The best description of Advent of Code (which happens annually; I'm linking to 2023) is its "About" page which lives here:

  [Advent of Code 2023 About Page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)

Please read that web page, but my short description is this: Advent of Code is a web site that gives 25 two-part programming problems in the days leading up to Christmas.  The problems are brought to you by the site's author, Eric Wastl.  The problems start easy and generally get harder.  One two-part problem is presented each day.  You don't get to see the second part of the problem until you have the correct answer to the first part.

The problem descriptions and examples are the same for everyone.  However, the input data and correct answer is unique to you.  This means you will have to log in, as described on the about page.

The problem description is not reproduced here.  The about page explicitly asks you not to.

## What's in this repo

* A bash pipe solution by John Gruber.  He addresses part two of the problem.
* A javascript solution by Justin Triplett.
* A perl solution by Jim McQuillan.  He addresses both parts of the problem.
* A python solution by Wolf.  He addresses both parts of the problem.
* A rust solution, again by Justin Triplett.
* A swift solution by Dave Satwicz.

## What's _not_ in this repo, and why

We are still looking for the other presenter from the audience who wrote a unique solution during the presentation.  We would love to get this solution into this repo.  We're going to re-watch the YouTube video and reach out to that person.

Note as described above, this repo does not contain the final answers or input data (both are unique to the participant).  You wouldn't get the same answer with _your_ data file, an answer from the repo wouldn't be correct, and wouldn't get you to part two of the problem.
